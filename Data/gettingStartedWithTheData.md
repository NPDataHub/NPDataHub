# Getting Started with the Data
This is a guide to how to understand and interact with the data to run your own analysis. 

### Our Data
Our data has been pulled from the irs and cleaned in many areas. It focuses on the published financial data from non-profit in NY. For our sake, the headings have been abbreviated. However, we provide the header key below.

### Running Analysis
If you would like to run your own analysis on the data. Feel free to clone this repository. The dataAnalysis.py program in this directory is a great starting place. It reads in all of the values from the data and demonstrates how to pull out specific data points. It also demonstrates one example for plotting some of this data using the plotly python library.  
  
For more information on building plotly graphs feel free to check out their documentation at https://plotly.com/python/.
