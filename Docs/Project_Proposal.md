# NP DataHub
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/babyspider/NP_DataHub/) <br /> 

## Overview
NP DataHub wil be a website for other non profits, policy makers, and donors to view information on non profits. This will help the end user in making informed decsions. We will pull from the publicly availible data on non profits produced by the IRS. Then through deploying machine leanring algorithms we will gather an in depth analysis of all non profits we have data for. Finally we will publish our findings to and pretty website. <br />

## Semster Plan
While our end goal for the project is an all encompassing website. We will start off small choosing only one [NTEE code](https://nccs.urban.org/project/national-taxonomy-exempt-entities-ntee-codes) to go in depth on. Following choosing an NTEE code, we will begin gathering all relevant data and storing everything in a database. Once we get a database set up we can start implementing some basic algorithms just so we can get some output to put up on our website. We would then like to explore some interesting algorithms we can design for fiscal variables and maybe even be able to measure impact of orgs within an NTEE sector. <br />

## Technology
plotly <br />
Other Open Source Data Vis Tools maybe one of these https://rigorousthemes.com/blog/best-open-source-data-visualization-tools/<br />
Javascript and Python <br />

## MileStones 
- Week 1: Identify one of 26 NTEE sectors within New York State, which will serve as a testing sample for algorithmic construction, platform development, and data visualization implementation. 
- Week 2: Establish the preliminary database foundation for the NTEE sample and associated functionality to be implemented within the V1.0 platform.
- Week 3: Establish the V1.0 platform with associated end-user functionality for data visualization/dashboard construction and algorithmic results.
- Week 4: Identify one public database source that aligns with the chosen NTEE sector to be included in advanced algorithmic construction. (Basically, what are we trying to tell the end-user or why are these results important?)
- Week 5: Begin testing phase on selected fiscal variables of individual nonprofits and associated NTEE codes and define their purpose. (What story are we trying to tell through data that will serve the public interest based on fiscal performance?) Developers can establish the quantity of algorithms with a focus on quality.
- Week 6: Begin testing phase on selected fiscal variables of individual nonprofits and associated NTEE codes and define their purpose and alignment with the chosen public dataset. (What story are we trying to tell through data that will serve the public interest?) Developers can establish the quantity of algorithms with a focus on quality.
- Week 7: Finalize algorithms with an emphasis on accuracy and precision.
- Week 8:Incorporate findings within the chosen open-source data visualization libraries.
- Week 9: Construct data visualization dashboard.
- Week 10: Launch V1.0 of the platform for user testing and presentation.
