This document explores the research we are doing for this project.

This is another open source data visualization library. It works in python and is based on Vega-Lite. It has a variety of different graphing capabilities including the normal ones(bar graph, scatter plots, etc.) as well as map-based visualizations.

This is a javascript data visualization library. It seems really easy to integrate and it has a variety of visualization types including interactive ones. This program is good for simple data display that dont need much analysis. The disadvantage is that it does't allow for a lot of control over color schemes and graphics in general.

This is a clustering library with graphing capabilities. It has k-means and affinity propogation which could be very good for running analysis on the nonprofits. K-means seems very general purpose. Affinity propogation seems like an interesting way to cluster by similarity since it uses a graph approach.

This is a very good example on how to use flask to generate plots that you can pull into an html page. This will allow us to generate python graphs and run all our analytic tools through that and be able to display them through the dashboard.

These are both tutorials on how to build apps with Django. The second one focuses on using it with graphing. I think django might be better than flask for actually building out the dashboard
