If you would like to create a feature issue, please describe what feature and how it fits into the overall structure and make sure to describe it in as much detail as possible, also start the title with Feature: [Fill in here]. <br />
Lastly, if you find an issue with the documentation or feel that we are missing any, please explain what we are missing/ what needs to be fixed, what part of the documentation it belongs to and if it is a missing piece of documentation, what void does it fill.
