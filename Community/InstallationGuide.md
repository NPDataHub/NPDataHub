# Installing NP_DataHub
Different parts of this repository have different requirements to run.  
  
If you would just like to play with the visual dashboard, all you need to do is pull the repo and it will have all the dependencies needed. 
  
If you want to work on the data analysis side, we are using matplotlib, numpy and sklearn which can all be installed through either apt-get or pip.
