# Style Guidelines

### Python
- import statements at the top and on separate lines
- comment describing every function
- 4 spaces for indentation
- method definitions in a class are surrounded by blank lines
- use blank lines in functions to indicate logical separation
- put all function definitions at the top

### HTML
 - use indentation for hierarchy
 - all css should be in a style tag at the top of the document or in its own document
