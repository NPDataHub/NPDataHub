# Style Guidelines

### Python
- import statements at the top and on separate lines
- comment describing every function
- 4 spaces for indentation
- method definitions in a class are surrounded by blank lines
- use blank lines in functions to indicate logical separation
- put all function definitions at the top

### HTML
 - use indentation for hierarchy
 - all css should be in its own document
 - all javascript should be written in a seperate doc and imported in 
 - all chunks of code should include an inline comment
 - all imports in the head should include a comment of what it is / is from
